Today I completed the **Introduction to Cyber Security** room on TryHackMe. It covered core ideas like confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA Triad), and showed me how threats like phishing and malware work.

ðŸ§  **What I Learned**:
- The importance of patching and updates
- Why social engineering is the biggest threat
- That hacking is about curiosity, not chaos

ðŸ›  **Tools I used**:
- Kali Linux VM
- TryHackMe interface

This was my first step into the Red Team world. More to come.
